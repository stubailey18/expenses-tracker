# Expenses Tracker

This is a more complex version of an app I've had my delegates build when delivering React courses. It facilitates the adding, filtering, sorting, and plotting of household expenses. It uses React's useReducer hook to manage state shared by multiple components, e.g. expenses and filters. It uses chart.js for the plots because it's relatively simple to use and is responsive.

You can see the app in action [here](https://clever-bardeen-9f0e5d.netlify.app/). It is populated with dummy data for the first three months of 2020.
